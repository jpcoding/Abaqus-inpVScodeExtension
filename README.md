abaqus inp language support for VScode

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JP.abaqus

Features
This is an extension for abaqus inp language support. For now, some common commands have been added. More commanads will be available.

BTW, you cna use vs code built-in terminal to run absqus software. It would be very effective.

Sorry for the bugs in last version.

Note
this extention is converted from sublime version. Great thanks to SenhorLucas. https://github.com/SenhorLucas/AbaqusSublimePackage
